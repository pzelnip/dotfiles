"""cdr - handy way to launch VS Code with a given directory.

Does a fuzzy (substring) search, if any subdirectory contains the search term,
will open VS Code in that directory.

Works with Python 3.5+ and must have the VS code shell command set up (open the
command pallette and search for "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH")

For example, I often have a directory in ~/temp/sandbox where I git clone most
repos I work on.  As well I have a repo checked out at ~/dotfiles.  I also
sometimes have a drive mounted in /Volumes/CaseSensitive which contains a
sandbox directory containing some checked out repos.  This script allows me to
do something like:

cdr.py foo

and the first directory in:

~/temp/sandbox/*
~/dotfiles
/Volumes/CaseSensitive/sandbox/*

that contains "foo" will get opened up in VS Code.  Directories to search are
specified in ~/.cdr.json, which is a JSON file containing two keys: basepaths
and fullpaths.  "basepaths" will be expanded to search all 1st-level subdirectories
and fullpaths are searched as-is.  So the above 3 paths would be specified as:

{
    "basepaths": [
        "~/temp/sandbox",
        "/Volumes/CaseSensitive/sandbox"
    ],
    "fullpaths": [
        "~/dotfiles"
    ]
}

~ will be expanded to the full user's home directory (Pathlib's expanduser() is
called on the path string)
