Random notes from setting up my M1 MBA.

Installed slack via app store

Installed spectacle, opened, closed, then copied my JSON config over, & re-opened.

Installed keepassx (latest version, which is M1 ready)

Installed iterm2 (m1 ready).  Immported my config, which is a weird way of doing it: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/8029

brew install git
brew install git-extras
brew install bash-completion

brew install python3

python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m pip install virtualenvwrapper

edited bashrc to have path:

export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin:$PATH

following advice from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49711594/808804

brew install pipx

pipx install black

(added path for pipx commands to my PATH in .bashrc)

brew install starship

added to my bashrc: eval "$(starship init bash)"
